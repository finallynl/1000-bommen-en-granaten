# 1000-bommen-en-granaten
## Description
*1000 Bommen & Granaten* ("a thousand bombs and granates", the 'official' Dutch translation of Captain Haddock's (from TinTin) iconic "ten thousand thundering typhoons!") is a pirate themed card and dice game for which I made this web app to keep track of the score with.
I only made this for home use with my children (that's why all the text is in Dutch). However, the makers of the game, 999 Games, picked up the app and share it on their [Dutch website](https://www.999games.nl/duizend-bommen-en-granaten-dobbelspel.html).

## Technologies
The program uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## Translations
All the code is in English but the scorekeeper itself is (for now) only in Dutch. To help you understand it better, here are the English translations: <br>
speler --- player <br>
geen speler --- no player <br>
speel mee --- join in / play along <br>
