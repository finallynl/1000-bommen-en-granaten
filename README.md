# 1000-bommen-en-granaten
## Description
*1000 Bommen & Granaten* ("a thousand bombs and granates", the 'official' Dutch translation of Captain Haddock's (from TinTin) iconic "ten thousand thundering typhoons!") is a pirate themed card and dice game for which I made this web app to keep track of the score with.
I only made this for home use with my children, that's why all text but also classes and ID's are in Dutch. (However, the makers of the game, 999 Games, picked up the app and share it on their <a href="https://www.999games.nl/duizend-bommen-en-granaten-dobbelspel.html" target="_blank">Dutch website</a>.)
