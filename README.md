# 1000-bommen-en-granaten
"1000 Bommen & Granaten" ("a thousand bombs and granates", the 'official' Dutch translation of Captain Haddock's (from TinTin) iconic "ten thousand thundering typhoons!") is a pirate themed card and dice game for which I made this web app to keep track of the score with.
I only made this for home use with my children, that's why all text but also classes and ID's are in Dutch.

To help you to understand it better, here are the English translations for important content:
speler(s) --- player(s)
speel mee --- join in / play along
naamSpeler --- name player
punten --- points
